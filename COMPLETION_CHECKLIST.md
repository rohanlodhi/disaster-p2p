## 🧪 Testing Status

### Manual Testing Required
- [ ] Install on 2+ Android devices (API 26+)
- [ ] Grant all permissions
- [ ] Test peer discovery
- [ ] Test text message exchange
- [ ] Test SOS broadcast
- [ ] Test voice recording/playback
- [ ] Test mesh relay (3+ devices)
- [ ] Test GPS coordinate attachment
- [ ] Measure battery drain (24h test)

## ⚠️ Known Limitations

### By Design
- ✓ No encryption (speed over security in emergencies)
- ✓ No authentication (trust-based mesh)
- ✓ No message persistence (memory-only)
- ✓ No internet connectivity (completely offline)
- ✓ Limited range (BLE ~50m, WiFi ~100m)

### Technical Constraints
- ✓ Requires Android 8.0+ (API 26)
- ✓ BLE required (WiFi Direct optional)
- ✓ GPS optional but recommended
- ✓ Max 7 simultaneous BLE connections
- ✓ Voice messages uncompressed (PCM)
