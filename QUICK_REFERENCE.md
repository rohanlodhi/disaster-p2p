---

## 🚀 Quick Start (3 Steps)

### 1. Open in Android Studio
```bash
cd /home/rohan/Desktop/flame-courses/imp/EmergencyMesh
# Then: File → Open in Android Studio
```

### 2. Build Project
```bash
./gradlew build
```

### 3. Install on Device
```bash
./gradlew installDebug
# Or use Android Studio's Run button ▶
```

---

## 📱 First Launch

1. **Select Role**: Choose "Citizen" or "Official"
2. **Grant Permissions**: Allow all (Location, Bluetooth, Mic, etc.)
3. **Wait for Service**: Notification appears "Emergency Mesh Active"
4. **Start Testing**: App auto-discovers nearby peers

---

## 🧪 Testing Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Basic Message (2 devices)
```
1. Install on both devices
2. Wait for "Peers: 1" to appear
3. Type message → Send
4. Verify message appears on other device with GPS
```

### Scenario 2: Mesh Relay (3+ devices)
```
1. Arrange: Device A ↔ Device B ↔ Device C
2. Move A and C out of direct range
3. Send message from A
4. Verify C receives via B (check hop count)
```

### Scenario 3: Emergency SOS
```
1. Tap red "🚨 EMERGENCY SOS" button
2. All nearby devices receive notification
3. Message includes GPS coordinates
```

### Scenario 4: Voice Message
```
1. Tap "🎤 Record Voice"
2. Speak for up to 15 seconds
3. Tap "⏹ Stop Recording"
4. Voice sent to all peers
5. Recipients tap to play
```

## 🌍 Network Topology

```
Star-Mesh Hybrid:

BLE:           [All devices advertise + scan]
               ┌──────┬──────┬──────┐
               │      │      │      │
              Dev1  Dev2  Dev3  Dev4

WiFi Direct:   Group Owner (star topology)
               ┌─────────┐
               │  Owner  │
               └────┬────┘
            ┌───────┼───────┐
           Dev1    Dev2    Dev3

Combined:      Multi-path redundancy
```

---

## 📊 Message Flow

```
SEND:
User → MessageHandler (attach GPS)
     → MeshService
     → ConnectionManager
     → BLE + WiFi Direct
     → Broadcast to peers

RECEIVE:
BLE/WiFi → ConnectionManager (dedup)
         → MeshService
         → UI Update
         → Auto-relay (if hops < 5)
```

## ⚠️ Important Notes

### Security
- ❌ **No encryption** (speed priority in emergencies)
- ❌ **No authentication** (all peers trusted)
- ✅ Trade-off accepted for disaster scenarios

### Range Limitations
- BLE: ~50 meters open area
- Wi-Fi Direct: ~100 meters open area
- Mesh relay extends range (5 hops max)

### Device Requirements
- Android 8.0+ (API 26)
- Bluetooth Low Energy support (required)
- Wi-Fi Direct support (optional)
- GPS (optional but recommended)

## 🐛 Common Issues & Fixes

| Problem | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| Devices don't discover | Wait 30-60s, restart both apps |
| No GPS coordinates | Move outdoors, wait for GPS lock |
| Voice recording fails | Check mic permission granted |
| High battery drain | Normal, ~5-10% per hour expected |
